* Add levels to the game, where the ball speed increases with each level. easy, medium, hard?
* Make title constant unique across the game.
* For two players mode, add a pre-game screen to show the binding keys for each player.
* For multiplayer mode, add a pre-game screen where players can enter their names before start finding a match.
* Make the game end when a player reaches 10 points.
